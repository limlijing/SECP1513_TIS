## Event Overview

The ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 was convened on 11 December 2025 at Dewan Sultan Iskandar, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. This historic event marked the first ASEAN-level summit focused on quantum science and technology.

The programme was organized by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, with support from the Malaysia Quantum Information Initiative. Participants from research, policy, industry, academia, and student bodies across ASEAN and partner nations such as Japan were brought together.

Key agendas included regional collaboration, awareness of quantum technologies, and shared visions for advancing quantum research, education, and industry in ASEAN.

## Reflection

On December 11, 2025, I attended the ASEAN Quantum Summit at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. This experience gave me a clearer understanding of how quantum technology can transform everyday life and support the development of regions like Johor into future technology hubs.

The opening talk by **Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa (Osaka University)** introduced the fundamentals of quantum computing, particularly the concept of qubits and superposition. Despite current challenges such as error rates and scalability, the wide-ranging applications—from chemistry to cybersecurity—highlight the transformative potential of this field.

Subsequent talks discussed Singapore’s national quantum strategy, coordinated through the **National Quantum Office**, which integrates efforts in computing, communications, and sensing. This structured approach avoids fragmentation and strengthens research–industry linkages, enabling real-world applications such as GPS-free navigation and precision medical imaging.

Overall, the summit demonstrated that strategic coordination combined with application-driven research is essential for smaller nations to develop competitiveness in advanced technologies like quantum science.

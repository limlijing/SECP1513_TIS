## Event Overview

The ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 was convened on 11 December 2025 at Dewan Sultan Iskandar, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. This historic event marked the first ASEAN-level summit focused on quantum science and technology.

The programme was organized by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, with support from the Malaysia Quantum Information Initiative. Participants from research, policy, industry, academia, and student bodies across ASEAN and partner nations such as Japan were brought together.

Key agendas included regional collaboration, awareness of quantum technologies, and shared visions for advancing quantum research, education, and industry in ASEAN.

## Reflection

On December 11, 2025, the ASEAN Quantum Summit at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia was attended. Through this experience, a clearer understanding was gained regarding how everyday life can be transformed by quantum technology and how the development of regions like Johor into future technology hubs can be supported.

The fundamentals of quantum computing, particularly the concepts of qubits and superposition, were introduced in an opening talk by Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa (Osaka University). Despite current challenges such as error rates and scalability, the transformative potential of the field was highlighted through wide-ranging applications spanning from chemistry to cybersecurity. Singapore’s national quantum strategy was discussed in subsequent talks; this strategy is coordinated through the National Quantum Office, where efforts in computing, communications, and sensing are integrated. Fragmentation is avoided and research–industry linkages are strengthened by this structured approach, allowing real-world applications—such as GPS-free navigation and precision medical imaging—to be enabled. Overall, it was demonstrated by the summit that strategic coordination, combined with application-driven research, is required for competitiveness in advanced technologies like quantum science to be developed by smaller nations.

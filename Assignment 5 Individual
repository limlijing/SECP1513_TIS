On 14/1/2025, I have the opportunity to join an industry talk about Application developer analyst II.The speaker is Miss/Mrs Qaisara Rohzan gave a very engaging and informative talk that connected a personal career journey-from data analytics intern to supervisor of the Power BI team-with the operational realities of IT in a global materials science corporation such as PPG. The grounding of the discussion first in PPG's various business units, from aerospace coatings to automotive finishes, served well to establish tangible impacts of data work. At the heart of the presentation was an ingenious "restaurant and logistics" analogy that made concepts such as data pipelines, ETL processes, and network security challenges understandable and memorable. This combination of personal narrative, clear analogy, and honest discussion of technical hurdles of VPN dependencies and cloud migration provided a very realistic and motivational overview about the field of business intelligence, emphasizing that success is dependent not only on technical skill but also on business acumen, problem-solving, and mentorship.

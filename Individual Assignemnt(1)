reflection of ASEAN QUANTUM SUMMIT 2025
On December 11, 2025, I attended the ASEAN Quantum Summit at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. This experience gave me a clearer view of how quantum technology can transform everyday life and help shape the future of regions like Johor, my home city, into a technology hub.The first talk by Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa from Osaka University introduced the fundamentals of quantum computing, explaining how qubits use superposition. While current systems still face challenges such as error rates and scalability, their potential applications—from chemistry to cybersecurity—are truly transformative. This highlighted for me the importance of sustained research collaboration and innovation for ASEAN to remain competitive in this field.The later talks emphasized Singapore’s national approach, centered around the National Quantum Office, which coordinates efforts across computing, communications, and sensing. This structured strategy prevents fragmentation and supports integrated planning. Additionally, the focus on real-world applications—such as GPS-free navigation and precision medical imaging—shows how strong research-industry links can drive practical technology development.
Overall, I learned that combining strategic coordination with application-focused innovation is essential for smaller nations to build strength in cutting-edge fields like quantum technology.

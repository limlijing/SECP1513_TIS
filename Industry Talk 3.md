## Reflection
On 14/1/2025, an industry talk regarding the role of Application Developer Analyst II was attended, where an engaging and informative presentation was delivered by Miss/Mrs. Qaisara Rohzan. A personal career journey—from data analytics intern to supervisor of the Power BI team—was connected to the operational realities of IT within a global materials science corporation like PPG. Tangible impacts of data work were established through a discussion of PPG's various business units, while complex concepts such as data pipelines, ETL processes, and network security were made understandable by an ingenious "restaurant and logistics" analogy. A realistic and motivational overview of the business intelligence field was provided through an honest dialogue regarding technical hurdles like VPN dependencies and cloud migration, and it was ultimately emphasized that success is driven not only by technical skill but also by business acumen, problem-solving, and mentorship.

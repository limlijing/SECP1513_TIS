This course will introduce students to information systems and technology (IS / IT), as well as its uses in daily life both at home and at work. Various aspects of  IS / IT encompassing hardware, software, network, communications, internet, multiedia, graphics and system applications will be introduced. Students will be equipped with basic skills in handling PC installation and productivity tools via practical work in the labs, which shall comprise a major part of he study. At the end of the course, student should be able to distinguish basic IS / IT component and applications.This course also will improve the comunnication  skill through the presentation and group activity.

## Assignment 1 (Video)
The UTM Digital Open Day was attended for a first assignment, where academic excellence, innovative research, and a supportive learning community were explored during a day of motivation and discovery. In the first talk, delivered by Hj Madradzi bin Muhamad, system development was discussed with a focus on UTM Smart and the UTM Portal. The Agile Scrum Sprint methodology—characterized by fixed-length iterations of one to four weeks to deliver shippable product increments—is utilized for UTM Smart, while various subsystems, such as e-learning, are managed within the UTM Portal. In the second talk, presented by Mohd Hafiz bin Muhammad Nasir and Zahari bin Supene, the UTM Data Center was described as a Tier 3 facility where complex redundant components are used to ensure a secure and reliable environment for university operations. Additionally, the role of a Data Engineer was examined, including the technical challenges encountered, the skills required, and the specific flow of data pipelines from raw data to the workbase.

## Assignment 3 (Report)
I will apply the Agile method in my learning and project development process instead of relying on artificial intelligence to complete tasks for me. By using an agile method, I can better manage my academic projects and personal skill growth. Through this method, I can identify my weaknesses early and improve my coding, system design, and debugging skills by using my brain, not artificial intelligence. I also can focus on learning more technical skills like programming language and app development. At the same time, I will develop soft skills, especially communication skills to communicate with others confidently by joining some workshop and club. This approach will help me to handle more challenges effectively in the future.

## Individual Assignment(ASEAN QUANTUM SUMMIT 2025)
On December 11, 2025, the ASEAN Quantum Summit at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia was attended. Through this experience, a clearer understanding was gained regarding how everyday life can be transformed by quantum technology and how the development of regions like Johor into future technology hubs can be supported.The fundamentals of quantum computing, particularly the concepts of qubits and superposition, were introduced in an opening talk by Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa (Osaka University). Despite current challenges such as error rates and scalability, the transformative potential of the field was highlighted through wide-ranging applications spanning from chemistry to cybersecurity. Singapore’s national quantum strategy was discussed in subsequent talks; this strategy is coordinated through the National Quantum Office, where efforts in computing, communications, and sensing are integrated. Fragmentation is avoided and research–industry linkages are strengthened by this structured approach, allowing real-world applications—such as GPS-free navigation and precision medical imaging—to be enabled. Overall, it was demonstrated by the summit that strategic coordination, combined with application-driven research, is required for competitiveness in advanced technologies like quantum science to be developed by smaller nations.

## Project 
Personal goals are significantly impacted by design thinking, as improvements in communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills are fostered through this framework. During the process, problems faced by students were analyzed, and potential solutions were discussed thoroughly with team members. Furthermore, efforts were made to become more extroverted so that interview sessions with strangers could be conducted effectively. By utilizing this human-centered approach, complex challenges were addressed through collective brainstorming and empathetic inquiry.

# Individual Assignment (Industry Talk)
On 14/1/2025, an industry talk regarding the role of Application Developer Analyst II was attended, where an engaging and informative presentation was delivered by Miss/Mrs. Qaisara Rohzan. A personal career journey—from data analytics intern to supervisor of the Power BI team—was connected to the operational realities of IT within a global materials science corporation like PPG. Tangible impacts of data work were established through a discussion of PPG's various business units, while complex concepts such as data pipelines, ETL processes, and network security were made understandable by an ingenious "restaurant and logistics" analogy. A realistic and motivational overview of the business intelligence field was provided through an honest dialogue regarding technical hurdles like VPN dependencies and cloud migration, and it was ultimately emphasized that success is driven not only by technical skill but also by business acumen, problem-solving, and mentorship.

# Assignment 4 (Newsletter)
On 7/1/2025, an industry visit to JCorp (Johor Corporation) in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, was undertaken. During the industry talk, a deep understanding was gained regarding JCorp's strategic investments in its core business sectors, including agribusiness, wellness and healthcare, food and restaurant, and real estate and infrastructure.It was noted that a "Cloud-first" service was applied between 2020 and 2022, and plans were shared for the establishment of a state-of-the-art Command Centre by 2026, which is intended to serve as a central nerve system for real-time insights.Advice was also provided by the speaker regarding the wise use of Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing that AI should be mastered and outperformed through continuous self-improvement and the strategic use of time. A reflection on the future career path was prompted by this session, as it was highlighted that being prepared is defined not only by technical knowledge but also by the ability to see how various elements are connected.

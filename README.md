This course will introduce students to information systems and technology (IS / IT), as well as its uses in daily life both at home and at work. Various aspects of  IS / IT encompassing hardware, software, network, communications, internet, multiedia, graphics and system applications will be introduced. Students will be equipped with basic skills in handling PC installation and productivity tools via practical work in the labs, which shall comprise a major part of he study. At the end of the course, student should be able to distinguish basic IS / IT component and applications.This course also will improve the comunnication  skill through the presentation and group activity.

## Pc assemble
On 30/10/2025, I have the opportunity to hands on PC Maintenance. I learn how to installation the fan,hard disc and more.Each component was assembled very smoothly with the cooperation of my teammates.

## Assignment 1
My first assignment is video of industry visit UTM Digital.I am pleasure to visit UTM Digital Open Day and learn more about its academic excellence, innovative research, and supportive learning community. A day full of motivation and discovery.Talk 1: Information System ( Hj Madradzi bin Muhamad )Talk 2: Digital Infra & Data Engineering ( Mohd Hafiz bin Muhammad Nasir, Zahari bin Supene ).In talk 1okay ,I have learn about system development mainly about UTM smart and UTM portal.They used agile scum sprint in UTM smart.Agile scum isa fixed-length iteration, typically one to four weeks, during which a development team works to complete a specific set of tasks and deliver a potentially shippable product increment and for UTM portal itself have so many small system such as e-learning.The second talk, I learn the data center which utm data center at tier three once of the complex redundant component, provides a secure, efficient, and reliable environment for managing and storing data, supporting the university’s digital operations and research needs effectively.We also learn about what actually a data engineer,what challenge will be meet,skills will be learn and how data pipeline flows from data to workbase.

## Assignment 2
From the industry talk by PPG,I gained a deeper understanding of how a global company integrates IT, data analytics and ERP systems to support business operations.I realized the importance of aligning technology with businness needs,use cloud and AI tools, and keep everything running efficently .This talk highlighted the gap between academic learning and industry pratices,motivating me to improve my techniial skills and h=learn how to apply them in real situations.

## Assignment 3
I will apply the Agile method in my learning and project development process instead of relying on artificial intelligence to complete tasks for me. By using an agile method, I can better manage my academic projects and personal skill growth. Through this method, I can identify my weaknesses early and improve my coding, system design, and debugging skills by using my brain, not artificial intelligence. I also can focus on learning more technical skills like programming language and app development. At the same time, I will develop soft skills, especially communication skills to communicate with others confidently by joining some workshop and club. This approach will help me to handle more challenges effectively in the future.

## Individual Assignment(ASEAN QUANTUM SUMMIT 2025)
On December 11, 2025, I attended the ASEAN Quantum Summit at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. This experience gave me a clearer view of how quantum technology can transform everyday life and help shape the future of regions like Johor, my home city, into a technology hub.The first talk by Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa from Osaka University introduced the fundamentals of quantum computing, explaining how qubits use superposition. While current systems still face challenges such as error rates and scalability, their potential applications—from chemistry to cybersecurity—are truly transformative. This highlighted for me the importance of sustained research collaboration and innovation for ASEAN to remain competitive in this field.The later talks emphasized Singapore’s national approach, centered around the National Quantum Office, which coordinates efforts across computing, communications, and sensing. This structured strategy prevents fragmentation and supports integrated planning. Additionally, the focus on real-world applications—such as GPS-free navigation and precision medical imaging—shows how strong research-industry links can drive practical technology development.
Overall, I learned that combining strategic coordination with application-focused innovation is essential for smaller nations to build strength in cutting-edge fields like quantum technology.

## Project
Design thinking impacts my goals as it not only improved my communication skills but also improved my critical thinking skills, collaboration with team members and problem-solving skills. For example, I had analyzed the problems from the students and discuss with my team members to solve the problems. I also try to become more extroverted to communicate with stranger to do the interview session.

# Individual Assignment (Industry Talk)
On 14/1/2025, I have the opportunity to join an industry talk about Application developer analyst II.The speaker is Miss/Mrs Qaisara Rohzan gave a very engaging and informative talk that connected a personal career journey-from data analytics intern to supervisor of the Power BI team-with the operational realities of IT in a global materials science corporation such as PPG. The grounding of the discussion first in PPG's various business units, from aerospace coatings to automotive finishes, served well to establish tangible impacts of data work. At the heart of the presentation was an ingenious "restaurant and logistics" analogy that made concepts such as data pipelines, ETL processes, and network security challenges understandable and memorable. This combination of personal narrative, clear analogy, and honest discussion of technical hurdles of VPN dependencies and cloud migration provided a very realistic and motivational overview about the field of business intelligence, emphasizing that success is dependent not only on technical skill but also on business acumen, problem-solving, and mentorship.

# Assignment 4
On 7/1/2025, I have the opportunity to visit an industry, which is JCorp. A Johor Corporaction whcich located at Johor Bahru,Malaysia. In this industry talk, I have deeply understand how JCorp's investments on its core businesses, agribusiness, wellness and healthcare, food and restaurant, and Real Estate and infrastructure.From 2020 until 2022, they applied Cloud first service and on 2026,they plan to entablish a state of the art Command Centre to serve as central nerve system for real-time insights.The speaker also advise us to use AI wisely and make sure we can beat AI, use our time wisely to learn new thing and improve ourselves time by time.This session really make me reflect on my own path ahead.Being prepared is not just technically what you know,rather,it's about how you see anything connect.
